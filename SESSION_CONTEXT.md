# SESSION_CONTEXT

Technical handoff for `call_forecast`. Read alongside `README.md` (user-facing)
and `config.yaml` (every tunable, with defaults written out).

---

## 1. Project Overview

**What it does.** Ingests RetellAI-style call-analytics exports (CSV/XLSX),
cleans and validates them, aggregates to a daily grain, engineers features,
cross-validates six forecasting models, auto-selects the best, and emits
30/60/90-day forecasts with calibrated intervals — plus anomaly alerts, SHAP
explanations, Erlang-C staffing scenarios, CSV deliverables and a
self-contained HTML dashboard.

**Business purpose.** Diamond Kitchen and Bath runs an AI phone agent on
RetellAI. This answers: how many calls next month, what will they cost, when do
we need another person on the phones, and did anything unusual happen
yesterday. It complements the existing descriptive tools on the Desktop
(`RetellAnalyzer.py`, `RetellDashboard_Web.py`), which report on the past.

**Status.** Feature-complete against the original spec and working end to end.
**Not yet production-useful for point forecasts** — see §4.

**Active work.** Migrating the HTML dashboard to React. Branch
`feature/react-components`; PR 1 (payload contract), PR 2 (frontend scaffold)
and PR 3 (primitives + non-chart sections) are done. See §8.

**Test suite health.** Two test files currently crash *during collection* on
this machine for reasons unrelated to any recent change — see §4.

## 2. Current Architecture

**Stack.** Python 3.10+ · pandas · numpy · scikit-learn · XGBoost · statsmodels
· Prophet *(optional)* · SHAP *(optional)* · Plotly · holidays · PyYAML ·
pytest. No database, no service, no network calls. Pure batch CLI.

**Data flow.**

```
data/*.csv
  → ingest.load_calls()        CallRecords{frame, ValidationReport}
  → features.build_daily()     one row per calendar day (zero-call days included)
  → features.engineer()        (frame, FeatureSpec) — pure function
  → evaluation.evaluate_models()   per target: leaderboard + best_model + residuals
  → forecast.generate_forecast()   refit on all history; calibrate; 90 days; simulate paths
  → explain / anomalies / scenarios
  → pipeline._write_outputs()  17 CSVs
  → dashboard.build_dashboard()    reports/dashboard.html
  → models/manifest.json       fingerprint for retrain detection
```

Three targets throughout: `call_volume`, `avg_duration_sec`, `total_cost`.

---

## 3. Completed Work

Everything in the original spec is implemented: all six models, all requested
features, all four metrics plus sMAPE/MASE/bias, auto-selection, confidence
intervals, retrain-on-new-data, anomaly detection, SHAP, charts/dashboard, CSV
output, modular + documented.

### Design decisions that constrain future changes

**Feature families.** `FeatureSpec` tags every column `calendar` (known for any
future date), `autoregressive` (from the target's own history), or `exogenous`
(observed call properties). Multi-step forecasting treats them differently;
this is not cosmetic.

**`engineer()` is a pure function, re-run per recursion step.** The forecaster
appends one predicted day and re-runs the same function rather than maintaining
a second prediction-time feature path. O(n) per step, but n is small and it
eliminates train/serve skew by construction.

**A target never sees another target's lags.** Tomorrow's cost is unknown when
forecasting tomorrow's volume. `FeatureSpec.for_target()` enforces this.

**Selection on MASE, not MAPE or R².** MAPE is undefined on zero-call days
(59% of the real data); R² is routinely negative on intermittent series. Both
are still reported. MAPE ships with `mape_n` so a percentage from 4 days is not
mistaken for one from 40.

**Intervals from out-of-sample residuals, grouped by horizon step.** Day-90
intervals are wider because the model *was* worse at 90 days.

**Residuals are mean-centred; non-negative targets are re-centred after
clipping.** Both guard against an interval that does not contain its own point
forecast. Uncentred residuals from a biased model shift every simulated path;
clipping at zero moves probability mass upward, compounding with horizon.
Measured bias is *reported*, never silently subtracted.

**Monthly totals are simulated, not summed.** Moving-block bootstrap (7-day
blocks) preserves error autocorrelation. Summing daily quantiles would describe
a month where every day independently hits its worst case.

**Models are rebuilt, not serialised.** A retrain takes seconds to ~3 min;
pickled Prophet/statsmodels objects break across library upgrades.

**Retrain detection hashes file *contents*.** Not mtime (OneDrive and
`git checkout` rewrite those), not filenames, order-normalised.

**Models below `min_observations` are skipped with a logged reason** rather
than fitted on a handful of points and quietly trusted.

## 4. Current State

### Verified working

- Full pipeline on real data (159 calls / 71 days): ~2.5 min, all outputs.
- Full pipeline on `examples/sample_export.csv` (1,711 calls / 210 days).
- 154 unit tests + 18 doctests pass (of the files that collect — see below).

### Test collection crash (environment, not code)

`tests/test_ingest.py` and `tests/test_forecast_and_models.py` abort with
`Windows fatal exception: access violation` **during collection**. The other
five files, including everything added by the React migration, pass.

This reproduces on a clean `git worktree` of `HEAD` with no working changes, so
it is not caused by recent work. The environment has drifted well past what
`requirements.txt` pins:

    python 3.12.10 · pytest 9.1.1 · numpy 2.4.6 · pandas 3.0.5

Root cause is pytest 9's parametrize-ID generation calling
`_pytest.compat.ascii_escaped()` on a `np.nan` parameter value; that function
only handles `str`/`bytes`. Both crashing files pass `np.nan` (or tuples) as
parametrize values.

Two ways out, neither done yet because both are out of scope for the migration:

1. Wrap the offending parameters — `pytest.param(np.nan, id="nan")` in
   `test_ingest.py:36` and the tuple cases in `test_forecast_and_models.py`.
   Smallest change, keeps the new toolchain.
2. Pin `pytest<9` and `pandas<3` in `requirements.txt`. `pandas 3.0` is a major
   release the code has not been audited against, so this is the conservative
   choice and probably the right first move.
- Dashboard: 11 Plotly figures, no horizontal overflow, no clipped labels,
  light/dark toggle restyles both CSS and figures, fully offline.
- Retrain lifecycle: `check` exits 1 when pending / 0 otherwise; `--only-if-changed` skips correctly.

### The headline caveat

On the **real 71-day export**, no model meaningfully beats the naive benchmark:

| Target | Winner | MAE | MASE | R² |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `call_volume` | random_forest | 3.29 | **1.34** | −0.24 |
| `avg_duration_sec` | seasonal_naive | 29.36 | 0.80 | 0.07 |
| `total_cost` | random_forest | 0.54 | **1.36** | −0.00 |

MASE > 1 means worse than "repeat recent same-weekday values". Learned models
for `avg_duration_sec` are all **skipped** — 29 observed days is below the
30-observation floor.

**This is a data-volume limit, not a code defect.** The same pipeline on the
210-day synthetic sample reaches MASE **0.79 / 0.69 / 0.79** with 24 CV folds,
and three different models win. Re-check with `--data-dir examples`.

### Running it

```bash
python -m venv ~/.venvs/callforecast     # MUST be outside OneDrive (see §6)
~/.venvs/callforecast/Scripts/pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m call_forecast run -v                    # full pipeline
python -m call_forecast run --data-dir examples   # against the sample
python -m call_forecast check                     # exit 1 = retrain pending
python -m call_forecast inspect                   # data quality only
python -m call_forecast forecast call_volume
python -m call_forecast watch --interval 300

python -m pytest tests/ -q
python -m pytest --doctest-modules call_forecast/ -q
```

`data/` and `outputs/` are gitignored — the real export is business data and is
not in the repo. Drop exports into `data/` to use them.

---

## 5. Remaining Work

### Not implemented
- **Intra-day / hourly forecasting.** The heatmap shows the hourly pattern but
  modelling is daily. Hourly staffing needs an intra-day model.
- **No alert delivery.** Anomalies land in CSV and the dashboard; nothing emails
  or posts to Teams.
- **No hyperparameter search.** Model params are fixed in config.
- **`check_latest_day()` in `anomalies.py` is written and tested only
  indirectly** — no CLI command exposes it. It is the intended hook for a daily
  scheduled alert job.

### Known limitations (documented, not bugs)
- 90-day intervals are extrapolated past the 7-day CV horizon.
- Exogenous features are held at a trailing 28-day average across the horizon.
- Minute-resolution timestamps + no call ID → cross-file de-duplication matches
  on content plus within-file position. A call ID would make this exact.
- Erlang assumes Poisson arrivals; real traffic is burstier, so estimates are
  mildly optimistic.
- `scenarios.*` defaults (1 agent, 9h, 80%-in-30s, 100s patience) are
  placeholders. The staffing column is fiction until they are set.

### Technical debt
- `dashboard.py` is 1,152 lines and does layout, theming and figure
  construction. Split figures from HTML assembly if it grows further.
- A full run is ~2.5 min, dominated by Prophet refitting per CV fold. No
  caching of per-fold fits.
- `explain.py` catches broad `Exception` in several places — deliberate
  (explanation must never cost you the forecast) but it can mask real errors;
  they are logged at WARNING.

### Recommended next steps, in order
1. Accumulate history. Nothing improves forecast quality as much. Re-evaluate
   when `models/metrics_history.csv` shows MASE < 1.
2. Set the real `scenarios` values so staffing output becomes actionable.
3. Add alert delivery on top of `check_latest_day()`.
4. Add a `direction` column to the export if RetellAI can provide it — the
   inbound/outbound features activate with zero code change.

## 6. Development Guidelines

**Environment.** Create virtualenvs **outside** OneDrive (`~/.venvs/<project>`).
OneDrive locks files mid-install and corrupts pip. Skip
`pip install --upgrade pip` — most collision-prone write, rarely needed.

**Conventions.**
- Module docstrings explain *why*, not just what. Comments justify non-obvious
  decisions; skip them for self-evident code.
- Typed frozen dataclasses for config; `dataclasses.replace()` to override.
- Public functions take `cfg: AppConfig | None = None` and default it.
- Return rich result objects (`ForecastResult`, `EvaluationResult`,
  `AnomalyReport`), not bare tuples.
- Data-quality problems accumulate on a report object and are surfaced; they do
  not raise unless the run cannot proceed.
- Log with the module logger. Never `print()` outside `cli.py`.

**Patterns.**
- New model: subclass `Forecaster` (or `TabularForecaster`), register in
  `models/registry.py`, add a `min_observations` entry. Everything downstream
  discovers it.
- New feature: add it in `features.engineer()` and tag its family on
  `FeatureSpec`. Shift anything derived from a target by ≥1 day.
- New output: add to `pipeline._write_outputs()`.

**Do not:**
- Compute a feature from the same day's target without shifting. The leakage
  test in `tests/test_features.py` will catch it — do not weaken that test.
- Lower `models.min_observations` to make skipped models appear. The floor is
  the honesty mechanism.
- Silently bias-correct a forecast from few CV folds. Report the bias.
- Clip a simulated distribution without re-centring it (`base.py`
  `_enforce_non_negative` explains why).
- Sum daily quantiles to get an aggregate interval. Simulate paths.
- Let a diagnostic failure (SHAP, dashboard) abort the run — CSVs are the
  load-bearing deliverable.
- Add a dual-axis chart, use colour alone for status, or ship a chart without a
  table view. The dashboard follows an audited palette; re-validate if you
  change hues.
- Introduce a CDN/network dependency in the dashboard. A test asserts against it.

## 7. Next Recommended Claude Tasks

PR-sized, roughly independent, most valuable first.

1. **Add a `alert` CLI command wrapping `anomalies.check_latest_day()`.**
   Evaluate only the most recent day, print findings, exit 1 if any critical
   alert fired. Write `outputs/alerts_today.csv`. Add tests for the exit code
   and the empty case. This is the hook a scheduled job needs.

2. **Add optional email/Teams webhook delivery for critical alerts.** New
   `call_forecast/notify.py` with a `notifications` config section (disabled by
   default; webhook URL from an env var, never committed). Called from the
   `alert` command only when critical anomalies exist. Test with a mocked
   transport.

3. **Cache per-fold model fits during cross-validation.** Prophet dominates the
   ~2.5 min runtime by refitting on every fold. Add opt-in memoisation keyed by
   (model, target, train-slice hash) under `models/.cv_cache/`, with a size cap
   and invalidation on config change. Target: halve the wall time. Assert
   leaderboard numbers are unchanged.

4. **Split `dashboard.py` into `dashboard/figures.py` and
   `dashboard/layout.py`.** Pure refactor — figure construction separate from
   HTML/CSS assembly, `build_dashboard()` signature unchanged. Existing
   dashboard tests must pass untouched.

5. **Add `--from` / `--to` date filtering to the CLI.** Restrict ingestion to a
   window for backtesting a past period or excluding a known-bad stretch.
   Thread through `AppConfig.data`, record the filter in the manifest, and note
   it in the dashboard header.

6. **Add hourly-grain aggregation and an hourly volume forecast.** New
   `build_hourly()` beside `build_daily()`, reusing the existing feature
   families with hour-of-day terms. Daily forecasting stays the default; expose
   as `--grain hourly`. This is what intra-day staffing needs.

7. **Add a `--tune` flag running a small time-series-aware hyperparameter
   search** (`sklearn` `HalvingRandomSearchCV` with the existing rolling-origin
   splitter) for random forest and XGBoost. Persist the winning params to
   `models/tuned_params.json` and load them on later runs. Skip when history is
   below ~120 days and log why.

8. **Add a coverage test for interval calibration.** Over the CV folds, check
   the share of actuals falling inside the stated interval and assert it is
   within tolerance of the nominal level. Write the result to the leaderboard as
   a `coverage` column. This is the missing check on whether intervals are
   honest, not just coherent.

9. **Support a `direction` column end to end once RetellAI exports it.** The
   feature code already exists and is dropped by the zero-variance filter. Add a
   fixture with direction data, assert `inbound_outbound_ratio_prev` survives,
   and add inbound/outbound split charts to the dashboard.

10. **Add GitHub Actions CI.** Run pytest + doctests on push and PR against
    Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 on `windows-latest` and `ubuntu-latest`. Install
    without the optional extras on one matrix leg to prove Prophet/SHAP
    degradation works.

---

## 8. React Dashboard Migration

**Branch.** `feature/react-components`.

Replacing the Python-rendered `reports/dashboard.html` (1,268 lines of string
assembly, 5.08 MB output, 4.9 MB of it inlined Plotly) with a React app that
consumes the JSON payload. The single-file, offline, mailable property is
preserved — the target is one self-contained HTML file, just a much smaller one.

### Done

**PR 1 — payload contract** (merged, `e1b8394`). `call_forecast/serialize.py`:
`build_payload()` / `dumps()` / `write_payload()`, plus
`outputs/dashboard_data.json` from `pipeline._write_outputs()`. 57 tests.

The load-bearing detail is JSON safety. `json.dumps` emits bare `NaN` and
`Infinity` tokens that are **invalid JSON** and throw in `JSON.parse`, and this
data is dense with them — `avg_duration_sec` is null on 42 of 71 real days.
Every non-finite float becomes `null`; `dumps()` then uses `allow_nan=False` so
anything that escapes raises at write time rather than failing in a browser.
`<`, `>` and `&` are escaped so an anomaly message containing `</script>`
cannot close the tag it will be inlined into.

**PR 2 — frontend scaffold, theme system, shell** (merged, `0238bcf`). Vite +
React 19 + TypeScript strict. Header, two-column layout, model rail, footer and
theme toggle render from a committed fixture. No charts yet.

**PR 3 — primitives and non-chart sections** (this branch). `Card`, `Section`,
`StatTile`/`TileGrid`, `Callout`, `DataTable` and `TableView` under
`components/primitives/`, and the four chart-free sections — Data Quality, At a
Glance, Anomalies and alerts, Scenario analysis — under `components/sections/`.
Their entries are gone from `PendingSections.tsx`, which now lists only
chart-bearing work.

Three things are worth knowing before touching the tables.

*JSON has already destroyed the int/float distinction.* `_table()` prints an
`int64` column as `{:,}` and a float column with the table's `numeric_format`,
but `1` and `1.0` both arrive here as `1`. Detecting integer-ness from the
value would print `0` where the Python dashboard prints `0.00`. So `DataTable`
takes a per-table `digits` and columns opt out with `digits: 0`;
`deriveColumns(rows, { integerKeys })` is how a caller names them. Today that
is `current_agents` and `required_agents` in the scenario table. **A new
integer column in `scenarios.py` must be added to `INTEGER_COLUMNS` in
`ScenariosSection.tsx`** or it will render with two decimals.

*Columns carry an accessor, not a string key.* Payload rows are declared as
interfaces, and a TypeScript interface is not assignable to
`Record<string, CellValue>` under `strict`, so keyed indexing does not
typecheck. `Column.value` is a function; the one cast this needs lives in
`deriveColumns` and nowhere else.

*Sorting is opt-in, and missing values sort last in both directions.* The
direction sign is deliberately not applied to the missing-value branch — a
descending sort that floated a column's gaps to the top would read as "these
are the largest", which is the opposite of what `null` means in this payload.
The sort is stable, and default order is always the payload's, so an untouched
table matches the Python dashboard row for row.

Two deliberate departures from `dashboard.py`, both of which make the React
version slightly better rather than different: tables carry a visually hidden
`<caption>` and sortable `<th>`s carry `aria-sort`, neither of which the Python
tables had. Two deliberate non-departures: header text stays the raw payload
key (`volume_uplift_pct`, not "Volume Uplift Pct") because those identifiers
also name CSV columns, and `anomalies.notes` is still not rendered, because the
Python section does not render it either.

### Frontend architecture

**Stack.** Vite 7 · React 19 · TypeScript 5.9 · CSS Modules. Five dependencies
total, no UI kit, no state library, no CSS framework. Node is a **dev**
dependency: end users still `pip install` and run the CLI.

**Payload loading** (`src/data/loadPayload.ts`) — three sources in order:

1. inline `<script id="dashboard-data" type="application/json">` — production;
2. `fetch('./dashboard_data.json')` — served mode, and the seam an API plugs into;
3. the committed fixture — **dev only**, behind `import.meta.env.DEV` so Vite
   drops it from production builds.

The fetch branch checks `content-type` for `application/json`, not just
`response.ok`: Vite's SPA fallback answers a missing `dashboard_data.json` with
`index.html` and a 200, which would otherwise be parsed as JSON and fail hard
instead of falling through to the fixture.

**Theme.** `src/theme/tokens.css` is **generated** from
`call_forecast.dashboard.THEME` by `scripts/gen_tokens.py`;
`tests/test_tokens.py` fails if the checked-in file drifts. The palette is
audited, so one source of truth matters more than convenience.

Light is the base in `:root`; `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` applies dark
when the viewer has not pinned light; `:root[data-theme="dark"]` overrides both.
Because the OS case is pure CSS, the right palette is applied *before* React
mounts — no flash. `data-theme` is only stamped once the viewer chooses, which
is exactly how the Python dashboard behaves. `useTheme()` exposes `mode` (what
is rendered) and `preference` (`light` / `dark` / `system`); an explicit choice
persists to `localStorage` under `call-forecast:theme`.

**State.** No library. `ThemeContext` for theme, `useState` in `App` for rail
selection. The payload is immutable and arrives once. TanStack Query becomes
correct the day there is a live API, not before.

**Layout.** `grid-template-columns: var(--rail) minmax(0, 1fr)`. The
`minmax(0, 1fr)` is load-bearing — a bare `1fr` lets a wide table or chart force
the page into horizontal scroll. Below 900px the rail collapses to a
horizontally scrolling strip; the page itself never scrolls sideways.

### Remaining steps

**PR 4 — `PlotlyChart` base + forecast charts.** The riskiest PR; timebox the
wrapper before committing to the rest. Use `plotly.js-cartesian-dist-min`
(scatter + bar + heatmap, ~1.1 MB) not the full 4.9 MB bundle. Consider a ~40
line `Plotly.react()` wrapper over `react-plotly.js`, which is thinly maintained
and defaults to the full bundle.

**PR 5 — remaining charts.** Monthly cost, heatmap, leaderboard, importance,
anomaly. The anomaly chart goes *into* the existing `AnomaliesSection`, above
the tally table, rather than into a new section. Three fixes from
`dashboard.py` are easy to silently drop and are therefore acceptance criteria:

- `xaxis.type: 'category'` on the monthly chart, or Plotly parses `"2026-08"` as
  a date and **drops the `(partial)` bars**;
- `xaxis.type: 'category'` on the heatmap, or `"00".."23"` land on a numeric scale;
- `constraintext: 'none'`, or Plotly clips `"$3.90"` to `"$"` on a narrow bar.

**PR 6 — single-file bundling and pipeline integration.** `vite-plugin-singlefile`,
a committed template at `call_forecast/assets/`, payload injected as an inline
script. Target ≤ 2 MB (from 5.08 MB). Needs a CI check that rebuilding the
template produces no diff, or a stale template will ship.

**PR 7 — real rail behaviour.** Filter the page to one model; put selection in
the URL hash. Charts inside `display:none` get zero dimensions — mount lazily or
resize on reveal.

**PR 8 — flip the default, retire `dashboard.py`.** Keep `--legacy-dashboard`
for one release.

**PR 9 — CI.** Node build + typecheck + pytest. Folds into §7 item 10.

### Frontend conventions

- camelCase for structural keys, snake_case preserved for data identifiers
  (`modelLabel` vs `call_volume`, `yhat_lower`).
- **Every payload number can be `null`.** Not an edge case.
- Colours come from custom properties, never literals. Re-run
  `scripts/gen_tokens.py` after any `THEME` change.
- Wide content scrolls inside its own container; the page never does. The
  15-column scenario table is the current worst case and is verified not to
  push the page sideways at 375px.
- Sections compose primitives; they do not write their own table, tile or
  callout markup. A section that needs new chrome extends a primitive.
- `frontend/README.md` has the workflows, including regenerating the fixture
  (which comes from `examples/`, never from `data/` — it is committed).
